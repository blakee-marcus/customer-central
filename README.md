<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This web application is designed to allow users to manage customer relationships by creating customers, adding notes about them, and keeping track of past communication entries.
The primary goal of this project is to provide users with a simple and user-friendly interface for managing customer relationships. This application is perfect for small businesses or individual entrepreneurs who need an easy way to keep track of their customer interactions.
The key features of this application include:

- Creating and managing customer profiles: Users can create new customers, update existing customer information, and delete customers as needed.
- Adding notes: Users can create and save notes about each customer, such as their preferences, past purchases, or any other relevant information.
- Adding communication entries: Users can also add entries about past communication with customers, such as phone calls, emails, or in-person meetings. These entries can be used to track the history of customer interactions and to remind users of any outstanding tasks or follow-ups.
